        <h2>ALGEBRA</h2>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra">
            Algebra is one of the broad areas of mathematics, together with number theory, geometry and analysis. In its most general 
            form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols. It is a unifying thread 
            of almost all of mathematics.
